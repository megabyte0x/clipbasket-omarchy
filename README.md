# Clipbasket for Omarchy

A clipboard manager that lives in your [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org) bar. Search
everything you have copied, filter by kind, paste it back — without leaving the
keyboard.

Free, forever, on Omarchy. Nothing to compile, nothing to run as root.

```sh
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/clipbasket/clipbasket-omarchy --enable
```

That is the whole install: Omarchy clones the plugin, validates it, and enables
it. The bar pill appears and clipboard capture starts with the shell â there is
no separate daemon to install, and no install script to trust.

Check it over afterwards with:

```sh
~/.config/omarchy/plugins/clipbasket.clipboard/bin/clipbasket-omarchy doctor
```

## Keyboard shortcuts

While the basket panel is open:

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| Type anything | Search as you type |
| `ALT + K` | Jump focus to the search bar and select the current query |
| `↑` / `↓` | Move the selection |
| `Enter` | Paste the selected clip straight into the focused window (copies only if `wtype` is missing) |
| `Click` | Same as `Enter` — pastes the clicked clip directly, no `SUPER + V` / `CTRL + V` needed |
| `→` / `i` | Inspect the selected clip |
| `Esc` | Close the panel |
| `Tab` | Switch bar panels |

## Requirements

Everything is in the Arch repositories; Omarchy already ships most of it.

| Package | Why | Required |
|---|---|---|
| `sqlite` | The history database (`sqlite3` CLI) | yes |
| `wl-clipboard` | `wl-paste` watches the clipboard, `wl-copy` writes it | yes |
| `jq` | JSON in and out of the shell scripts | yes |
| `python` | HTML → Markdown conversion (standard library only) | yes |
| `imagemagick` | Image thumbnails; without it the full image is shown | no |
| `wtype` | Sends a paste keystroke into the focused window (the on-by-default "paste immediately" setting) | no |
| `pandoc` | Used for HTML → Markdown when present; the built-in converter is the fallback | no |
| `tesseract` (+ `tesseract-data-eng`) | Reads text out of copied images so a screenshot is searchable by what it shows; without it image text search is simply off | no |

Nothing is downloaded, compiled, or run as root at any point.

## Uninstall

```sh
# If you had switched SUPER + CTRL + V to Clipbasket, hand it back first:
~/.config/omarchy/plugins/clipbasket.clipboard/bin/clipbasket-omarchy restore-default

omarchy plugin remove clipbasket.clipboard
```

`omarchy plugin remove` stops the capture service, drops the bar pill and
deletes the plugin folder (it leaves a `.clipbasket.clipboard.bak.<timestamp>`
copy beside it, which is safe to delete). Your history and settings are kept so
a reinstall picks them up; to erase them too:

```sh
rm -rf ~/.local/state/clipbasket ~/.config/clipbasket
```

Nothing else on the system is touched: the only file the plugin ever edits
outside its own directories is `~/.config/hypr/bindings.lua`, and only when you
ask it to via `make-default`.

## What this is

Clipbasket for Omarchy is a **native Quickshell plugin** — a bar widget, a
popup panel and a capture service written in QML, over a SQLite history.

It shares a name and a design with [Clipbasket for macOS and
Windows](https://clipbasket.com), and nothing else. There is no shared code: the
desktop app is Rust and React in a Tauri shell, and this is QML talking to
Omarchy's own components. Treating it as a port would mean carrying a lot of
decisions that only make sense on a platform where the app owns its own window,
its own theme, and its own updater. On Omarchy, the compositor owns the
keybinding, Omarchy owns the theme, and the marketplace owns the updates — so
this is built
around that instead of fighting it.

The practical consequence: **best-effort feature parity, no promises.** Features
land here when they make sense here. Some never will. See
[What's different from the macOS app](#whats-different-from-the-macos-app).

## What it does

- A monochrome bar pill built on Omarchy's own `BarIconButton`, so it themes itself.
- A popup panel built from Omarchy's `Panel` / `KeyboardPanel` / `PanelKeyCatcher`
  chrome — native anchoring, animation, theming, Esc-to-close, Tab panel-switching.
- Search, type filters (All / Text / Links / Images / Files / Saved), and clip rows
  with copy and paste actions.
- A settings page covering the options that mean something on Wayland, persisted to
  `~/.config/clipbasket/settings.json`.
- A capture service that records clipboard history to SQLite and skips anything a
  password manager marks confidential. It runs inside the shell and stops with
  it — there is no daemon of ours to install, supervise, or leave running.

## Coexisting with Omarchy's clipboard

Omarchy ships its own clipboard overlay, `omarchy.clipboard`, on **SUPER + CTRL + V**.

**Clipbasket does not take that binding when you install it.** You get a bar pill
and nothing else changes. Try both, keep the one you like.

When you decide, flip **Use Clipbasket for Super+Ctrl+V** in the panel's settings
page — or do the same thing from a terminal:

```sh
cd ~/.config/omarchy/plugins/clipbasket.clipboard
bin/clipbasket-omarchy make-default      # SUPER + CTRL + V opens Clipbasket
bin/clipbasket-omarchy restore-default   # give it back, exactly as it was
```

`make-default` edits `~/.config/hypr/bindings.lua` inside a clearly delimited
block, after backing the file up. `restore-default` deletes that block and
nothing else, and re-enables `omarchy.clipboard` only if `make-default` was the
thing that disabled it. Both are safe to run repeatedly. See
[docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md) for exactly what is written where.

## The CLI

Nothing links it onto your PATH — a plugin folder may not contain symlinks, and
the marketplace install runs no script that could make one elsewhere. Run it from
the plugin directory, `~/.config/omarchy/plugins/clipbasket.clipboard/bin/`:

```
clipbasket-omarchy enable              Enable the bar widget and the capture service
clipbasket-omarchy disable             Disable both (your history is kept)
clipbasket-omarchy make-default        Take SUPER + CTRL + V
clipbasket-omarchy restore-default     Undo make-default exactly
clipbasket-omarchy status              What is installed and enabled
clipbasket-omarchy doctor              Diagnose a broken install, PASS/FAIL per check
```

Every command that writes to your config takes `--dry-run` and will show you the
exact change first.

`doctor` is the thing to run before asking for help. It checks the Omarchy CLIs,
`sqlite3`, `wl-clipboard`, `jq`, the plugin directory, whether the widget is
enabled, whether the capture watchers are running, whether the database is writable and
intact, whether your settings file is valid JSON, whether the keybinding is in
`bindings.lua`, and whether Hyprland has actually loaded it.

## What's different from the macOS app

| | macOS / Windows | Omarchy |
|---|---|---|
| Price | Paid, licensed | Free |
| Global shortcut | Owned by the app, changed in Settings | Owned by the compositor, changed in `bindings.lua` |
| Theme | Light / Dark / System setting | Omarchy's theme, always |
| Updates | In-app updater, checks daily | `omarchy plugin update clipbasket.clipboard` |
| Accessibility grant | Required for automatic paste | None; Wayland uses `wtype` |
| Auto-paste | Built in | Needs `wtype` installed |
| Launch at login | Login item / registry Run key | Not a setting — capture runs whenever the shell does |
| Storage | App-support directory | `~/.local/state/clipbasket/clips.db` |

Settings that exist on macOS and deliberately do **not** exist here — theme,
automatic update checks, launch-at-login, the paste-permission grant — are listed with their
reasons in [`settings.schema.json`](settings.schema.json) under
`x-clipbasket.notInThisPort`, so nobody has to guess whether they were forgotten.

Full setting-by-setting detail is in [docs/SETTINGS.md](docs/SETTINGS.md).

## Development notes

Hard-won specifics that are not documented elsewhere, discovered while building
this against Omarchy 4.0.0 / Quickshell 0.3.1:

1. **Editing QML requires a full shell restart.** `omarchy-shell shell rescanPlugins`
   registers a newly added plugin, but does **not** reload QML already in memory,
   and Quickshell's file watcher does not cover `~/.config/omarchy/plugins/`. The
   dev loop is:
   ```sh
   pkill -f "quickshell -n -p"
   setsid systemd-cat -t omarchy-shell -- quickshell -n -p "$OMARCHY_PATH/shell" &
   ```
   Symptom if you forget: runtime errors citing line numbers that no longer exist.

2. **`bar.shellQuote()` does not exist.** It is documented in Omarchy's
   `shell/plugins/bar/README.md`, but calling it throws
   `TypeError: Property 'shellQuote' ... is not a function`. Quote locally instead.

3. **Export `OMARCHY_PATH`** when driving the plugin CLI outside a full desktop
   session, or commands fail with a misleading `find: '/shell/plugins'` error.

4. **Use `\uXXXX` escapes for Nerd Font glyphs**, not literal characters. Literal
   PUA codepoints get stripped by some editors and transports, and an empty
   `text: ""` silently collapses a bar widget to zero width — an invisible widget
   with no error.

5. **Bar widgets that own a panel must expose the shape contract** the bar's
   popout coordinator expects: `open()`, `close()`, `opened`, plus
   `popoutSwitchClosing` / `closeForPopoutSwitch()` forwarded from the panel.

## Layout

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `manifest.json` | Plugin declaration (`kinds: ["bar-widget", "service"]`, entry points, bar metadata) |
| `BarWidget.qml` | The bar pill; owns the panel and forwards the shape contract |
| `Panel.qml` | The popup: clip list, clip detail and settings views |
| `Service.qml` | The capture service: the two `wl-paste --watch` processes, owned by the shell |
| `bin/clipbasket-omarchy` | The CLI: enable, disable, make-default, restore-default, status, doctor |
| `settings.schema.json` | The settings contract — names, types, defaults, and what was dropped |
| `docs/INSTALL.md` | Install, upgrade, uninstall, and exactly what touches your config |
| `docs/SETTINGS.md` | Every setting, what it does, and why the absent ones are absent |
